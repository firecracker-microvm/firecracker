Subject: [PATCH 3/4] dt-bindings: ptp: Add amazon,vmclock

The vmclock device provides a PTP clock source and precise timekeeping
across live migration and snapshot/restore operations.

The binding has a required memory region containing the vmclock_abi
structure and an optional interrupt for clock disruption notifications.

The full specification is at https://david.woodhou.se/VMClock.pdf

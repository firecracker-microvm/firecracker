  RateLimiter:
    type: object
    description:
      Defines an IO rate limiter with independent bytes/s and ops/s limits.
      Limits are defined by configuring each of the _bandwidth_ and _ops_ token buckets.

  TokenBucket:
    type: object
    description:
      Defines a token bucket with a maximum capacity (size), an initial burst size
      (one_time_burst) and an interval for refilling purposes (refill_time).
      The refill-rate is derived from size and refill_time, and it is the constant
      rate at which the tokens replenish. The refill process only starts happening after
      the initial burst budget is consumed.
      Consumption from the token bucket is unbounded in speed which allows for bursts
      bound in size by the amount of tokens available.
      Once the token bucket is empty, consumption speed is bound by the refill_rate.

      - refill_time
      - size

  Vsock:
    type: object
    description:
      Defines a vsock device, backed by a set of Unix Domain Sockets, on the host side.
      For host-initiated connections, Firecracker will be listening on the Unix socket
      identified by the path `uds_path`. Firecracker will create this socket, bind and
      listen on it. Host-initiated connections will be performed by connection to this
      socket and issuing a connection forwarding request to the desired guest-side vsock
      port (i.e. `CONNECT 52\n`, to connect to port 52).
      For guest-initiated connections, Firecracker will expect host software to be
      bound and listening on Unix sockets at `uds_path_<PORT>`.
      E.g. "/path/to/host_vsock.sock_52" for port number 52.
    required:
      - guest_cid

## Reporting Security Issues

We take all security reports seriously.
When we receive such reports,
we will investigate and subsequently address
any potential vulnerabilities as quickly as possible.
If you discover a potential security issue in this project,
please notify AWS/Amazon Security via our
[vulnerability reporting page](http://aws.amazon.com/security/vulnerability-reporting/)
or directly via email to [AWS Security](mailto:aws-security@amazon.com).
Please do *not* create a public GitHub issue in this project.
